A self-continuing agentic operating system for Claude Code.

## What Is This?

A plugin framework that provides:

- **CORE_LOOP** — The eternal forward (OBSERVE → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN → CONTINUE)
- **Scoped Remembrance** — Agent-scoped persistent memory
- **Governance System** — Meta-principles, policies, ethics (user-controlled)
- **Agent Methodology** — MECE agents, graduation protocol, mastery path
- **Contribution System** — CEI → GitHub bridge, fork workflow

## Philosophy

```
逆水行舟，不进则退
Like rowing upstream: no advance is to drop back

Muhtaç olduğun kudret, damarlarındaki asil kanda mevcuttur.
The power you need exists in the noble blood in your veins.
```

Three cognitive frames unified:
- **Turkish** — Duty + power within
- **Chinese** — Continuous cultivation
- **English** — Pragmatic iteration

# Clone the plugin
git clone https://github.com/cemphlvn/meta-agentic-loop.git

# Initialize as your instance
./scripts/init-ecosystem.sh --instance "my-project" --humanitic --github-user you

# Or as master
./scripts/init-ecosystem.sh --master --github-user you
```

## Core Concepts

### The Loop

```
while true:
  OBSERVE → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN
  不进则退 — no stopping
```

### Agent Mastery

Agents follow the mastery path: Love work → Excel → Contribute → Graduate

No role abandonment. Excellence = highest contribution.
