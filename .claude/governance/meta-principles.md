## What Are Meta-Principles?

Meta-principles are the foundational truths that govern all other rules. They answer:
- **Why does this project exist?**
- **What values are non-negotiable?**
- **What is the ultimate purpose?**

Agents read these principles. Agents obey these principles. Agents cannot change them.

## Structure

### 1. Core Purpose
> *What is the fundamental reason this project exists?*

```
[USER TO DEFINE]

Example:
"To democratize brand strategy through AI, making sophisticated
marketing intelligence accessible to creators who previously
couldn't afford it."
```

### 2. Non-Negotiable Values
> *What values must never be compromised, regardless of efficiency gains?*

```
[USER TO DEFINE]

Example:
- Authenticity over virality
- User privacy over data collection
- Sustainable growth over explosive scaling
```

### 3. Philosophical Foundation
> *What worldview underlies all decisions?*

```
[USER TO DEFINE]

Example:
"We believe in the Turkish-Chinese-English unified framework:
- Progress is duty (vazife)
- Progress is continuous (不进则退)
- Progress is validated through iteration"
```

### 4. Boundaries
> *What will this project NEVER do, even if profitable?*

```
[USER TO DEFINE]

Example:
- Never sell user data
- Never create deceptive content
- Never optimize for addiction
```

### 5. Success Definition
> *How do we know we've succeeded?*

```
[USER TO DEFINE]

Example:
"Success is when a creator's authentic voice reaches the audience
who needs to hear it. Metrics are indicators, not goals."
```

## Agent Compliance

All agents MUST:
1. Read this file on session start
2. Align all actions with these principles
3. Halt and escalate if action would violate principles
4. Never attempt to modify this file

Violation of meta-principles = immediate agent halt + user notification.
