# Governance Proposals

> Proposals for governance changes are stored in the CEI Structure.

**Location**: `/user/CEI_STRUCTURE/proposals/`

Governance files (meta-principles, policies, ethics, curiosity-of-curiosity) are **USER-ONLY**.
Agents cannot modify them but can propose changes via CEI.

## To Propose a Governance Change

```bash
/governance request {proposal}
# or
/cei propose governance "{summary}" "{details}"
```

This creates a proposal in `/user/CEI_STRUCTURE/proposals/` for user review.

## To Review Proposals

```bash
/cei review
/cei pending
```
