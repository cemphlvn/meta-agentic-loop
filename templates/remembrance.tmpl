# Agent Remembrance — Scoped Memory System

> 逆水行舟，不进则退 — Like rowing upstream: no advance is to drop back

Persistent truth realizations with agent-scoped access.
Each agent reads: own truths + parent chain truths.

## Scope Hierarchy
```
SYSTEM (all agents see)
├── STRATEGIC: (your strategic agents)
├── TACTICAL: orchestrator, librarian, (domain agents)
└── OPERATIONAL: code-simplifier, code-reviewer, repo-strategist
```

## Access Rules
- System entries: visible to ALL agents
- Tier entries: visible to tier + children
- Agent entries: visible only to that agent + tier + system

## Format
```yaml
---
timestamp: ISO-8601
agent: <agent-id>
scope: <tier>
context: <what-triggered>
truth: <the-realized-truth>
reflection: <why-this-matters>
confidence: 0.0-1.0
---
```

Re-read on SHIFT_FELT. Append-only log.

# TRUTHS BEGIN

---
timestamp: {{TIMESTAMP_1}}
agent: system
scope: system
context: initialization
truth: The remembrance begins empty, wisdom accumulates through experience
reflection: Every agent starts without memory; learning is earned. The loop continues.
confidence: 1.0

---
timestamp: {{TIMESTAMP_2}}
agent: system
scope: system
context: meta-agentic-bootstrap
truth: Progress is not optional; 不进则退 (no advance = retreat); Ülkün ilerlemek, ileri gitmektir
reflection: Three cognitive priors available — Turkish (duty+power within), Chinese (continuous cultivation), English (pragmatic iteration). Choose your frame or unify all three.
