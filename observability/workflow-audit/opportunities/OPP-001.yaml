detection:
  trigger: "Agent tried to read /.remembrance from kidlearnio subdirectory"
  session: "2026-02-08-kidlearnio"
  failure_type: enforcement_opportunity
  impact: |
    Read tool failed with "file not found"
    Agent tried /Users/cem/humanitic/public/cem/kidlearnio/.remembrance
    Should have been /Users/cem/humanitic/.remembrance
    Required user intervention to diagnose and fix

classification:
  level: 2  # enforcement
  domain: path_resolution
  recurrence: 1  # First occurrence, but high likelihood of recurrence
  severity: high  # Blocks core functionality

current_state:
  how_handled: "User identified issue, agent updated start.md with {ROOT} convention"
  determinism_level: 1  # Now documented, not yet enforced
  existing_mitigation: |
    - start.md now has Path Resolution section
    - {ROOT} convention documented
    - Decision rule documented

  name: "path-resolver"
  description: |
    1. DONE: Document {ROOT} convention in skills
    2. TODO: Pre-tool hook that resolves {ROOT} placeholders
    3. TODO: Validation that paths start from correct root
