hypothesis:
  statement: "Agent invocation frequency correlates with truth contribution rate"
  rationale: |
    Agents that are invoked more frequently have more opportunities
    to observe, reason, and crystallize truths. If this correlation
    is strong (>0.8), dispatching more subagents should directly
    increase the system's learning rate.

expected_outcome:
  metric: "correlation(agent_invocations, agent_truths)"
  threshold: "> 0.8"

test_protocol:
  method: "correlation"
  data_source: ".remembrance agent and truth counts"
  interval: "daily"
  duration: "7 days"
  formula: "pearson_correlation(invocations[], truths[])"

observations:
  - date: 2026-02-07
    data:
      system: { invocations: 17, truths: 17 }
      orchestrator: { invocations: 3, truths: 3 }
      cto-agent: { invocations: 2, truths: 2 }
      librarian: { invocations: 1, truths: 1 }
      compliance-auditor: { invocations: 1, truths: 1 }
      code-implementer: { invocations: 1, truths: 1 }
    correlation: 1.0
    notes: "Perfect correlation on day 1 — each invocation produced exactly 1 truth"

conclusion: null
implementation: null
