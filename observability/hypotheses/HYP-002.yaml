# Hypothesis HYP-002 — Validation Coverage Correlation
---
id: HYP-002
created: 2026-02-07T22:00:00Z
agent: system-scientist
status: proposed

hypothesis:
  statement: "Higher validation certainty levels correlate with fewer runtime issues"
  rationale: |
    Research revealed 5 certainty levels in validation:
    1. Existence (absolute)
    2. Syntax (high)
    3. Semantics (moderate)
    4. Integration (low)
    5. Purpose (lowest)

    Current validators cover levels 1-2. If we add level 3-4 validators,
    runtime issues should decrease proportionally.

expected_outcome:
  metric: "issues_detected_at_runtime / total_changes"
  threshold: "< 0.1 (10% escape rate)"
  baseline: "unknown - need measurement"

test_protocol:
  method: "before-after comparison"
  data_source: ".audit/issues.log, remembrance errors"
  phases:
    - name: "baseline"
      duration: "7 days"
      validators: ["structure", "skills", "agents", "remembrance"]
    - name: "enhanced"
      duration: "7 days"
      validators: ["+ semantic", "+ integration"]

observations: []

conclusion: null
implementation: null
