agent: system-scientist
status: proposed

hypothesis:
  statement: "Sessions that read .remembrance produce higher quality outputs"
  rationale: |
    The loop protocol states: "remind yourself to remind yourself"
    .remembrance contains accumulated wisdom and shape_shifts.
    Sessions that consult it should avoid past mistakes and
    build on crystallized truths.

expected_outcome:
  metric: "quality_score(session_outputs) when remembrance_read vs not"
  threshold: "> 20% improvement"

test_protocol:
  method: "A/B comparison"
  data_source:
    - ".observability/remembrance-tracker.json"
    - "session outputs quality ratings"
  measurement:
    - "shape_shifts produced"
    - "errors avoided (present in remembrance)"
    - "build on existing truths"

observations: []

conclusion: null
implementation: null
