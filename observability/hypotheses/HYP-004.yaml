# Hypothesis HYP-004 — Meta-Improvement Recursion Depth
---
id: HYP-004
created: 2026-02-07T22:00:00Z
agent: system-scientist
status: proposed

hypothesis:
  statement: "Improving the improvement system yields compounding returns"
  rationale: |
    The system that improves the system is a meta-level concern.
    If we improve validation → we catch more issues → fewer bugs → faster iteration.
    If we improve that improvement process → even faster.

    This is "rowing upstream" - 不进则退 (no advance is to drop back).
    The question: is there a recursion depth where returns diminish?

expected_outcome:
  metric: "time_to_value at each meta-level"
  threshold: "diminishing returns at level 3+"

test_protocol:
  method: "recursive measurement"
  levels:
    1: "improve code" → measure velocity
    2: "improve validators" → measure issue escape rate
    3: "improve validator-improvement process" → measure validator quality
    4: "improve meta-improvement" → measure at what depth returns diminish

observations: []

conclusion: null
implementation: |
  If validated: Focus investment at optimal recursion depth
  If rejected: Meta-improvement always valuable, continue investing
